## Hello, I'm Ilea 👋

I'm an **Infrastructure Engineer** and **Tech Enthusiast** passionate about building reliable, scalable systems. My journey in technology started with curiosity about how things work under the hood, and it has evolved into a career focused on server infrastructure, networking, and system administration.

### What I Do

- 🖥️ **Server Infrastructure** - Designing and maintaining robust server environments
- 🌐 **Networking** - Building secure and efficient network architectures  
- 🐳 **Containerization** - Docker, Kubernetes, and modern deployment strategies
- 🔧 **Automation** - Scripting and automating repetitive tasks
- 📊 **Monitoring** - Implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions

### My Philosophy

> "Building reliable systems, one server at a time."

I believe in the power of well-documented, maintainable infrastructure. Every cable, every configuration, every line of code should serve a purpose and be understandable to the next person who works on it.
